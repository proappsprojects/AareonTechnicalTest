# AareonTechnicalTest
Title: Aareon Ticketing System

Description: Implemented RESTful api to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tickets.

Woring-in-progress:

I managed to implement RESTful endpoint(s) for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Added automated testes for Create and Read actions under project AareonTechnicalTest.Tests.
Services are Data folder are under same solutions. In a real time project, I would put them in a separate project.  
Work-in-progress/Work not completed


1. Services and Database layers should go into a separate project of their own. 
2. Unit tests are not created/add for service layer. 
3. No exception logging added to the project. Setting up ELMAH or similar tool will help store error in a central location	
4. I didn’t add Notes field/column to a Ticket.
5. I didn’t add data manipulation and actions.
